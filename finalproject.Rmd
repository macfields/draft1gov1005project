This dataset is from Hubway. It shows the location of BlueBike Stations(Boston Metro Bike Share System). There are 193 observations in this dataset. I would like to look at the demographics of neighboorhoods where stations are located. 
There is also data available on trip durations, routes, and station popularity. I may look at combining some of this data.
